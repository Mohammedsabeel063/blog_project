A gluten-free (GF) diet is a way of eating that excludes gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This dietary approach is essential for individuals with celiac disease, a serious autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption. People with gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy also benefit from following a gluten-free diet to alleviate symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Many food products are naturally gluten-free, such as fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, and dairy products. However, individuals following a GF diet need to be cautious of hidden sources of gluten in processed foods, sauces, and condiments. It is important to read food labels carefully and choose certified gluten-free products to ensure a safe and healthy diet.
