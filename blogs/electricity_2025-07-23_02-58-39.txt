Electricity is a form of energy that powers our modern world. It is the flow of electric charge through a conductor, such as a wire. Electricity is generated at power plants using various sources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, and renewable sources like wind and solar. It is then transmitted through power lines to homes, businesses, and industries. Electricity plays a crucial role in our daily lives, powering our lights, appliances, electronics, and transportation systems. Understanding how electricity works and practicing energy conservation are important for ensuring a sustainable and efficient use of this valuable resource.
